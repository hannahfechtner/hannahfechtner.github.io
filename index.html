<h1>Hannah Fechtner</h1>
<p>I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon, advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/">Jeremy Avigad</a>. </p>

<p>
    I'm working on all sorts of things to do with braids, including formalizing a solution to the braid word problem in Lean, 
  tracking down the history of the algebraization of braids, and making interactive outreach tools to share the mathematics of (un)tangling.
